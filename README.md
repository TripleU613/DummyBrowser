# DummyChromeBrowser 🛡️

A simple, lightweight Android application that acts as a system-wide URL blocker. Instead of browsing the web, it intercepts all link clicks and displays a "restricted access" screen with a random, fun animation.


## 🚀 Concept

The goal of this app is not to be a web browser, but to be a *browser replacement*. It's designed to be set as the default browser on an Android device to effectively block all user-initiated navigation to web links or other registered URL schemes.

## ✨ Features

*   **Acts as Default Browser**: Can be set as the default system browser via a user-friendly prompt.
*   **Universal Link Interception**: Catches `http`, `https`, and common app schemes like `tel:`, `mailto:`, and `geo:`.
*   **Dynamic Block Screen**: Displays a clean "Access Restricted" message.
*   **Random Animations**: Rotates through a collection of 10 different Lottie animations each time a link is opened, making the experience more engaging.
*   **Lightweight & Efficient**: No `WebView`, no actual network requests. Just a simple UI screen.

👍Enjoy!
